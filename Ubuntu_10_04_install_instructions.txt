steps to install scavislam Ubuntu 10.04

1. edit pangolin cmakelists to make it compile with boost 1.4

edit Pangolin/pangolin/CMakeLists.txt

comment out SET(HAVE_BOOST_GIL 1)

Pangolin should compile now

2. Upgrade cmake to compile opencv with cuda support

Download:
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

For reference, here are the install instructions:
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html

Under "Source distributions" Download the cmake tar.gz for Unix/Linux
unzip into ScaViSLAM/EXTERNAL
$ cd ScaViSLAM/EXTERNAL/cmake<version number>
$ ./bootstrap --prefix=/home/kir1pal/svslocal/
$ make

and then I used checkinstall:
$ sudo checkinstall

and finally I had to put a symbolic link in /usr/bin
/usr/bin$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/cmake cmake

I realize this is not most the optimal way to install cmake, but it worked for me.

opencv should now compile with CUDA support enabled.  
This can be checked when you run cmake in the opencv build directory.  There will be some output that says "WITH_CUDA" macro is defined
