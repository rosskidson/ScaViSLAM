steps to install scavislam Ubuntu 10.04

1. install boost as external library for dependancy Pangolin:

$ cd ScaViSLAM/EXTERNAL
$ svn co http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/trunk boost
$ cd boost
$ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=~/svslocal (or wherever you put the install for scavislam external libraries)
$ ./b2 install

Hack the CMakeLists.txt to use new boost:
comment out 
#FIND_PACKAGE(Boost COMPONENTS thread filesystem system REQUIRED QUIET)
and add
SET(Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS /home/kir1pal/svslocal/lib)
SET(Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS /home/kir1pal/svslocal/include)
to EXTERNAL/Pangolin/pangolin/CMakeLists.txt

disable build examples in 
EXTERNAL/Pangolin/CMakeLists.txt

Pangolin should now compile.

2. Upgrade cmake to compile opencv with cuda support

Download:
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Install instructions:
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html

I used:
$ cd to/cmake/directory
$ ./bootstrap --prefix=/home/kir1pal/svslocal/
$ make

and then I used checkinstall:
$ sudo checkinstall

and finally I had to put a symbolic link in /usr/bin
/usr/bin$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/cmake cmake

I realize this is not most the optimal way to install cmake, but it worked for me.

opencv should now compile with CUDA support enabled.  
This can be checked when you run cmake in the opencv build directory.  There will be some output that says "WITH_CUDA" macro is defined
